# Slippi Wrapped

## How to set up locally

1. Clone this repo & [my modified `slippi-js` library](https://github.com/CMarah/slippi-js).
2. Rename the modified `slippi-js` library folder to `marahslp`.
3. Go into the new `marahslp` folder & build: `npm run build`.
4. Go into this repo's folder, install & launch server `npm run start`.
